# Trinket/ATtiny85 Ardunio Variants

The hardware folder contained here should be copied 
into your Arduino ~/sketchbook directory.

It contains a boards.txt file with trinket3 and trinket5 
( 3v and 5v versions ) definitons and pins_ardunino.h

## Easy Installation

Just run:

    ./install

This will create a sketchbook folder in your home directory 
if it does not already exist, and copy in the hardware dir.
