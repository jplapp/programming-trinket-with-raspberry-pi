# Software Serial

This example demonstrates the use of SoftwareSerial with the Trinket.

You must connect your TX and RX pins from the Pi to D3 and D4.

The Makefile in this example forces it to compile for the Trinket3 @ 16Mhz 
using the Trinket5 BOARD_TAG, but it should work fine for either board.
